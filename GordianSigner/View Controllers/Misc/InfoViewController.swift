        Accounts are holders of Bitcoin value. An account map describes the account. An account can also generate addresses, where you will receive money.

You can alternatively import an account map using the QR code from apps like Gordian Wallet, Specter and Fully Noded. When you are done, you can export your account map or your addresses, receive transactions, and make payments on the payments tab.
