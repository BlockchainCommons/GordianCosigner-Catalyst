        An account is a sequential list of addresses that can be summed into a balance: it is a holder of Bitcoin value. The addresses are where you receive that value. 
        
        An account map is a full Bitcoin descriptor of an account, including metadata, but built using only xpubs. For a multisignature account, the account map describes the multisig.

        To create an account, CREATE a policy defining how many cosigners are possible and how many of those signatures are required, and then ADD cosigners from your cosigners tab. You can alternatively IMPORT an account map using a QR code from an app like Gordian Wallet, Specter, or Fully Noded. When you are done, you can export your account map or your addresses, receive transactions, or make payments on the payments tab.
        
        You will typically import an account map created from another device, defining a multisig account.

        A cosigner is an individual or a device that can be used to create multisignatures accounts.

        To add a cosigner, choose IMPORT to paste an xpub with origin info, crypto-account, crypto-hdkey, crypto-seed, or bip39 words, or scan a QR code. This must be done for everyone who will be participating in a multisignature account. When you are done, proceed to the accounts tab to combine cosigners into a multisignature account.

        A payment is Bitcoin transactions sent from your account. It will be imported into Gordian Cosigner as a partially signed transaction (PSBT) created by Gordian Wallet or another app.

        Signing is always done offline. Payments are automatically saved when you add a transaction or sign it.
